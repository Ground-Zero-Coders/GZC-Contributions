# ðŸ§  Projects

Welcome to the zone! ðŸš€  
Here, you can contribute small scripts, apps, or mini-projects to practice and learn.

### âœ… Guidelines:
- Create a folder with a **descriptive name** of your project.
- Include your code inside it.
- Add a `README.md` inside your folder to explain:
  - What your project does
  - Technologies used
  - How to run it

Feel free to experiment and contribute â€” no idea is too small!  
Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow together ðŸ’»âœ¨
